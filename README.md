A collection of tools and modules for producing the 2pt data products and necessary components for parameter estimation using them.

# Use

To run the pipeline interactively with the supplied Y1 yaml file, use (e.g., from 2pt_pipeline/) python -m pipeline --stage stage_name mcal.yaml

stage_name is one of nofz, 2pt, cov, write_fits.
